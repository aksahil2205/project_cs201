Summary:-
Our project aims to recreate a board game known as Scotland Yard,
a detective game where some detectives try to catch a criminal Mr. X who is
roaming around the city. We have used the knowledge of graphs and decision tree
to create a game such that you can play with the computer. In our game, we
act as detectives and Mr. X is controlled using the decision tree. We have used
graph to represent the city by using nodes as various stations where Mr. X and
the detectives can stay and using edges as the path where they can move. We
create new map every time we play the game using Barab√°si-Albert Model. The
detectives are human controlled while Mr. X is Algorithmically controlled using
the decision tree we created.
